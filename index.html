    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Product designer focused on craft, storytelling, and strategy at the intersection of digital design and consumer devices. Currently at Snap Lab, working on fun projects for Spectacles. Previously, worked on Monetization at Meta and the Alexa App and Echo Show suite at Amazon. Before diving into tech, I studied Architecture and worked on professional projects ranging from skyscrapers to masterplans. My work aims to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds, one thoughtful interaction at a time.</p>

      <p class="project-description">The latest 5th generation Spectacles are radical, see-through, standalone AR glasses that enable you to use Lenses and experience the world with friends in new ways. At Snap Lab, I wear multiple hats, drive design projects for the Spectacles Mobile App, and conceptualize on-device AR experiences with creative engineers, prototypers, and researchers.</p>
