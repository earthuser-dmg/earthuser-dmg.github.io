                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <p>In the winter of 2022, I worked at Decathlon as a Product Designer, leading the design of
                        business module system for the internal integration platform. This is my first project when I
                        joined Decathlon. The main challenges were new concept for all stakeholder, the lack of design
                        assets, and the steep learning curve in a new industry.</p>
                    <p>As a owner of this project, I built the 0-1 framework for the design content and shared my work
                        through active communication and regular feedback with the stakeholders.</p>

                    <div class="my-role">
                        <h3>My role</h3>
                        <p>I executed the tasks such as identifying issues, defining problem scopes, prioritizing tasks,
                            designing solutions, conducting testing, and overseeing the implementation process.</p>

                <div class="text-1">
                    <p>This was also my first time working on a B2B product, and I have to admit that I had limited
                        knowledge of the industry know-how. To quickly understand the business context and clarify my
                        design goal, I started by framing my exploration around four key questions to get the whole
                        picture. </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> the vision of my product </li>
                        <li> the end-users’ needs </li>
                        <li> UX resource and maturity within the team</li>

                    </ol>

                <div class="text-2">
                    <p>During the project, I gained several key insigts: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <p>
                        <h4>Product Scope</h4>
                        I was responsible for different modules along the production workflow — including inventory
                        management, demand forecasting, and others. Each of these represents a core operational step
                        within the supply chain.</p>
                        <p>
                        <h4>Platform Background</h4>
                        All of the products I worked on are part of an internal iPaaS (Integration Platform as a
                        Service) — designed to offer a unified entry point for business users, integrating multiple
                        domain-specific tools into one seamless, automated platform. The platform itself does not
                        operate business-facing products directly, but serves as an infrastructure layer that connects
                        and supports them.
                        <p>
                        <h4>Platform Background</h4>
                        One of our key user groups, the SPLs (Supply Planning Leads), faces a high turnover rate. The
                        main reason is the steep learning curve — it takes a long time to become proficient with the
                        system, and the internal training cost is very high.
                        <p>
                        <h4>Design System Adoption Gap</h4>
                        The design maturity varies across different teams:
                        Some teams had only one designer, who conducted some research and delivered partial mockups.
                        Other teams had no designer at all, and product managers used existing components from the
                        design system to assemble the interface on their own.
                    </ol>
