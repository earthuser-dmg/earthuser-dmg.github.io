                    <p>I’m a <strong>UX & Product Designer</strong> specialized in end-to-end design. I’m passionate
                        about
                        design systems and tackling complex problems—those are the parts of design that make me lose
                        track of time.
                        <br><br>
                        Over the past 3 years, I’ve worked with Decathlon and Alibaba, covering B2B, B2C, mobile, and
                        web. At Alibaba, I was in charge of flight products on the digital travel platform; at
                        Decathlon, I’ve been bridging production with digital transformation. Along the way, I’ve picked
                        up a pretty diverse skill tree—motion design, video editing, qualitative research, and service
                        design—because why stop at one tool when you can have the whole toolkit?

            <div class="me-text">
                <p>I got into design back in high school, when CMF and software design first blew my mind (before I even
                    knew the term HCI). That mix of curiosity, a problem-solving brain, and a streak of perfectionism
                    made it feel like I’d found my thing.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of work, I’m a coffee enthusiast to a slightly ridiculous degree, always chasing that
                    perfect cup. I have a ginger cat (you might have seen him playing on my homepage) and I love
                    painting, jogging, and live music. All of these hobbies feed back into my design—they keep my eyes
                    tuned to beauty and my mind open to new ideas.
